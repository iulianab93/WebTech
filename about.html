          <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
          <p> Spending time designing, producing & seeking my inspiration,  
            literally exposed my soul in the beauty & serenity of nature. All the 
            great splendour seemed to come over me; the delicate but robust and 
            awe-inspiring brilliance of all beautiful things came over me like heavy 
            rain that refreshes the earth & all things inside. <br> <br>
            When we go through the healing process, and after a while, we look back, I believe 
            we all carry the victory of our private shine. As experiences become discoveries, 
            behind those harsh, often dark & even dangerous times, we develop & discover messages. <br><br>
            My intense, burning desire to create beauty in a world not always so beautiful, stems from 
            trying to support those on the other side of the darkness who suffer domestic violence and aspire to survive.
            I need to share my message of courage, boldness & fearlessness for this purpose. Every design that we create 
            or work with contains this powerful energy. That's why a portion of your transactions at SHINES help women and 
            children escape the deadly darkness of domestic violence.</p>
            <p>With love,<br> Julie</p>
  
          <p class="rightCorner">
            My brand is our reminder that we are courageous, strong and fearless. We can resolve difficulties 
            in life, in every aspect of our being, regardless of what they may be & flourish on the other side 
            to improve the lives of our children, families & society.
          </p>

          <h1 class="page-title">What we do</h1>

          <p class="rightCorner">The team continually seeks to improve the cutting, faceting and build quality of the workshops, 
            instruments and materials used for this traditional knowledge. SHINES is committed to working with the best materials 
            and expecting the most beautiful future collections in the art of cutting if the lapidaries are intended to conduct almost 
            perfect faceting.</p>
